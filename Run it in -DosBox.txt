This is a way to use this program in Linux or Windows Vista/7 ect.
Linux should have "wine" installed to make things simpler.

Dosbox command -Alt+Enter for full screen 

Assuming that the installer installed in the default folder

TO open admin

mount c c:\admin\adminv2r
c:\ dir
adminv2r


To open Client

mount c c:\client\clienv2r
c:\ dir
clienv2r

If An Error appears that c: is already mounted

try changing "mount c ...."  to "mount d ...." or "mount e ..."

Eg.
mount d c:\client\clienv2r
d:\ dir
clienv2r
